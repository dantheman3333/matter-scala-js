# matter-scala-js
A scala-js facade for the matter-js physics engine

This project was created with the help of [adbrain's TypeScript definitions for matter-js](https://github.com/slavomirvojacek/adbrain-typescript-definitions/blob/master/matter-js/matter-js.d.ts) and [sjrd's TypeScript conversion tool](https://github.com/sjrd/scala-js-ts-importer).

I am unsure if I will continue working on this - seems unnecessary/unwise when you have the power to use Java and Scala physics engines - as it should not tie into the view part of MVC. Though, matter-js's debug renderer is mostly implemented.
